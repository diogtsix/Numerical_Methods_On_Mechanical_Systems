# Repository Documents Description
The repository "Numerical Methods on Mechanical Systems" encapsulates a detailed investigation into the dynamics of mechanical systems, employing a variety of numerical and analytical methods to solve complex engineering problems. The collection is divided into two parts, each meticulously documented by Diogenis Tsichlakis, with Part A focused on kinematic analysis and Part B extending into dynamic systems analysis.

Part A introduces the foundational concepts of oscillations within mechanical systems, specifically through the lens of a kinematic mechanism. This document meticulously explores the calculation and graphical representation of angles as functions of a crank's angle, leveraging the Sequential Continuation Method for solving non-linear algebraic equations. It emphasizes the role of the crank mechanism in driving the system, maintaining constant angular velocity, and the implications of this on the mechanism's members, which are considered undeformed. The document is structured around a series of questions, each leading the reader through the complexities of the kinematic analysis, underpinned by numerical methods like the Newton-Raphson (NR) method for solving systems of equations.

Part B builds upon the insights from Part A, delving into the dynamic aspects of mechanical systems. It emphasizes the equation of motion for the mechanism, constructed using Lagrange's method and the principle of virtual work, which allows for the simplification of complex mechanical systems into scalar quantities. This part significantly focuses on the application of numerical integration methods such as the Central Difference Method and the Newmark method for analyzing the system's response to dynamic loading and the effects of integrating an electric motor and a flywheel into the system. It also explores the selection of appropriate electric motors based on average power requirements and the iterative process involved in refining system parameters to meet desired performance criteria.

Both documents are rich in analytical rigor, applying engineering principles and numerical methods to solve real-world mechanical problems. They cover a broad spectrum of methodologies including the Newton-Raphson method for iterative solution of non-linear equations, the Central Difference Method for numerical integration, and the application of the Newmark method in dynamic analysis. Additionally, the documents utilize the principle of virtual works for formulating the equations of motion, offering a comprehensive toolkit for analyzing and optimizing mechanical systems.

The repository serves as a comprehensive resource for students, engineers, and researchers interested in the nuanced application of numerical methods to the oscillations and dynamics of mechanical systems. It stands as a testament to the intersection of theoretical knowledge and practical application in the field of mechanical engineering.
